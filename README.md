For this assgimenet I create a 5 cinemtaic slide that had a good understanding and proper use of thhe 8 element with in my code. Four of the scene are unique as it represent part of the game function with a loading, logo, menu, save, and game scenes which are using fading animation to transiton or edicate the sceen is changing. All the image and audio assets are done and made by me in Photoshop and Audacity that lay out the general feel how my game look and sound (eventhough it is not the best art and sound). The gemetric shapes that I used for my assigment is circle which had a scale in repeat at the loading and logo scenes. The logotype that I choose for my text is "Aqua" to represent "ocean" scene or feel. One of the object motion that I used is word coming from below or near the side where it transiton to one scene. The auido sound is a little bit off with the timing however it still plau out the sound effect which generally help lay out cinemtaic scene on the web. Overall this assigment was a little bit tough as there were some coding that need to be implemented to each word and sprite.
